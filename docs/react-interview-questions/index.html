This is the process that I would follow if I would be an interviewer. And this is the process that I would like to be part of as an interviewee.</p><p>Let's start with discussing what you must know as a front-end developer.</p><h2>What you must know as a front-end developer</h2><p>When I interview front-end developers I evaluate two critical skills:</p><ol><li>How do you solve problems</li><li>How do you solve front-end problems with front-end tools, such as JavaScript, React, Redux, etc.</li></ol><p>Software developers solve problems. That's the core value that they bring to the table. Front-end developers solve front-end problems with front-end tools.</p><p>If a business uses React, then their interview process should answer two questions: 1) how well can you solve problems, and 2) how well can you solve front-end problems with React. Naturally, knowing React (and other front-end tools) well, will help you to solve front-end problems well.</p><p>In your preparation for a front-end React interview adapt this mindset: React is only a tool that solves a specific problem. Master the process of solving front-end problems with React and you'll master React as a tool.</p><p>In this tutorial, I'll give you an example of a coding test that has a specific problem, that can be solved with React.</p><p>Let's discuss the interview process first.</p><h2>The interview process</h2><p>Personally, I prefer three stage interview process:</p><ol><li>A phone call conversation about my previous experience</li><li>A coding test</li><li>A face-to-face conversation about my solution for the coding test</li></ol><p>Over the years of interviewing for</p><h2>Step 1: Let's talk about your experience</h2><p>First, I want to learn about your previous experience of solving problems as a front-end developer. I am interested in hearing what problems have you solved and how you solved them.</p><p>You can talk about the products or features you've built, the team that you were part of and the constraints that you had to deal with.</p><p>Talk about high level first. What were you building, who was on your team and what was the development process that you've followed.</p><p>Then give examples of specific problems and then solutions. Mention solutions that you found that worked and - that didn't work - and what lessons you've learned from them.</p><p>Then talk about what are you looking for in your next role: what products are interested in building, what problems would you like to solve and what technologies would you like to learn.</p><p>The goal of this conversation is to establish the baseline for expectations - what should I expect your skills level to be and what you should expect from a new role.</p><h2>Step 2: Let's solve a problem</h2><p>Now it's time to test your skills. I will ask you to solve a specific problem.</p><p>This problem is an example of a task that you would get if you would join the company.</p><p>You can solve it at home or at your face-to-face interview as a pair programming exercise.</p><p>If you're asked to solve it at home, then the expectation is for you to spend less then a day on it.</p><p>If you're asked to solve it at the face-to-face interview, then it could be from an hour to two hours pair programming exercise.</p><p>The goal of this test is to see your current skills in action, get a sense of what you know about different aspects of software development and create a context for our next interview stage where we'll discuss your solution and I'll ask you any follow up questions that I might have.</p><h2>Step 3: Let's discuss how you solved a problem</h2><p>I'll review your solution for the coding test and prepare follow-up questions. We might talk about why have you chosen one solution over the other, how do you think about system design and architecture, how different data-structures affect performance and how do you choose the right one.</p><p>At this stage I'll learn more about your broader understanding of how to build a better software.</p><h2>Example of a coding test</h2><p>In this coding test you'll need to build a shopping cart using React.</p><p>Here's a list of all requirements: https://github.com/fedosejev/react-shopping-cart/blob/master/requirements/</p><p>Here's a live example of the React app that you need to build: https://fedosejev.github.io/react-shopping-cart/</p><p>Before you continue reading this tutorial - try to do the coding test and build the app yourself first. Take a maximum of one day of time. Choose a code editor that works for you best. I recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p><p>If you would like to see my solution, then here it is: https://github.com/fedosejev/react-shopping-cart</p><p>This coding test will drive the follow-up questions that I'll ask you in the Stage 3 of the interview process.</p><h2>The follow-up questions</h2><p><em>Coming soon.</em></p></div></div><hr><div class="mailchimp-form"><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form --><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form action="https://tips.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=e6ae402f40ee7f015cfdfc790&amp;id=8e05bece96" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate form-inline" target="_blank" novalidate><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="mc-field-group form-group"><label for="mce-EMAIL">Subsribe for new tutorials:</label><input type="email" value="" placeholder="Your email address" name="EMAIL" class="required email form-control" id="mce-EMAIL"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button btn btn-dark"></div><div id="mce-responses" class="clear"><div class="response" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="response" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups--><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_e6ae402f40ee7f015cfdfc790_8e05bece96" tabindex="-1" value=""></div></div></form></div><!--End mc_embed_signup--></div><hr><div class="add-this-sharing-buttons"><!-- Go to www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your tools --><div class="addthis_sharing_toolbox"></div></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
