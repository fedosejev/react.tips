# React Component Libraries

When you start a new React project usually you want to build the first version of that project as quickly as possible. Often the initial version of your project is called Minimum Viable Product or MVP, and it serves as a proof of concept for your business case.

Or you just have a tight deadline set by your company that you have to meet.

In either case, you don't want to reinvent the wheel and build React components from scratch over and over again. Components like buttons, checkboxes, dialogs, etc. are lower level components that are part of many React applications today. Hence, by now, someone already built those components and shared them with the world.

Why not reuse those?

Let's take a look at the most useful libraries of React components that are easy to use.

## Material UI

A collection of UI components for all purposes. Unfortunately, their Table component has no editing feature. I've used [React Data Grid](https://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid/) table with Material UI.

## Blueprint JS

A very strong alternative to Material UI. Includes Table component that can be edited.

## React Data Grid

A Table component with lots of flexibility and good performance.
