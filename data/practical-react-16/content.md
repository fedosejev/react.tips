# Practical React 16

Do your job faster and with higher quality with the most practical knowledge of React 16 today. That's what I aim to create: tutorials that are the most practical and helpful for you in your everyday job.

It's time to get practical with React.

What problems are you solving with React at your job today? Please leave a comment, this will help me to prioritise tutorials.

I would guess the most popular challenges in React are:
  + How to create and validate forms?
  + How to pass data from one component to another?
  + How to structure and organise React components?

I will be updating this list with new ideas.
